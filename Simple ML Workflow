Machine Learning Process

1. Loading Data
2. Preprocessing the Data
3. Training a Model
4. Evaluating the Model
5. Making Predictions

Aim to write a code that demonstrates a simple ML workflow using logistic regression which is a classifier.
Our code should load the data, prepare it for training, train a model and use it to predict results and print results.
