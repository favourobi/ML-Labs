A. The first step was to import all the useful libraries needed for the project.
B. Next, I loaded the Iris dataset, which was downloaded from [this link](https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201).
C. After downloading it, I loaded the CSV file into Jupyter Notebook to start working with it.
D. The next thing I did was clean the data to remove any unnecessary or missing values and make it ready for analysis.
E. Once the data was clean, I created a Machine Learning model using:

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
```

F. Then, I trained the model by fitting it to the dataset so it could learn the relationship between the input features (X) and the target labels (y).
G. Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions and see how well it performed.


You can see the code I wrote in MLP DEMO-checkpoint.ipynb
